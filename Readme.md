# Preparatory Quantum Transport Simulations

This repository contains a series of progressively advanced quantum transport simulations developed to build a foundational understanding of the **Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF)** formalism, tight-binding methods, and spin transport — in preparation for a more advanced project involving **spatio-eigen and time-dependent NEGF**.
